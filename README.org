* Rem
The unobtrusive, intuative memory augmentation tool for software projects

** How it works
  *Rem* recognizes you work on different projects and codebases. When
   you tell it to remember something, it remembers where you were when
   you wrote it down, what files you were working on (what link is in
   your clipboard?)

   It does this by storing a file in the root of the project (looking
   for a ~.git/~ directory - or other project-marking files). You can
   commit this file with the project if you'd like others to have
   these context sensative notes, or ignore it if you'd like them to
   remain your own alone.

** Invoking ~rem~
   #+begin_src sh
     rem 'refactor this_func since other_func handles this more robustly'
   #+end_src

** What makes a project?
    The following files tell =rem= that this directory marks the root
    of a project:

    - ~.git/~
    - ~.project~
    - *TODO* others? mercerial? other VCs?
